# Go-to-Market Strategy: Home Maintenance & Troubleshooting App

*Strategic Document 4 of 4 | Last Updated: January 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

Our go-to-market strategy prioritizes **organic acquisition** through App Store Optimization, content marketing, and strategic partnerships. With a target CAC of $3-4, paid advertising is only viable at scale. We launch in a **single metro market** (Austin, TX) to build density, validate service provider partnerships, and iterate before national expansion.

## 1. User Acquisition Strategy

### Channel Prioritization

| Channel | CAC Range | Volume | Priority | Phase |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| **ASO (organic)** | $0.50-1.50 | Medium | P0 | Launch |
| **Content SEO** | $0.30-1.00 | Medium | P0 | Launch |
| **Referral program** | $2-5 | Low-Medium | P1 | Month 2 |
| **Influencer (micro)** | $1-4 | Low | P1 | Month 3 |
| **Real estate partnerships** | $1-3 | Medium | P1 | Month 4 |
| **PR/earned media** | $0.10-0.50 | Burst | P2 | Launch |
| **Paid social** | $5-10 | High | P3 | Post-PMF |
| **Paid search** | $8-15 | High | P3 | Post-PMF |

**Strategy**: Exhaust organic channels before scaling paid. Paid acquisition only viable after proving unit economics with organic users.

### P0: App Store Optimization (ASO)

#### iOS App Store Optimization

**App Name**: `HomeHelper - Fix It Yourself` (30 char limit)
- Primary keyword: "Home" + "Fix"
- Clear value proposition

**Subtitle**: `DIY Troubleshooting & Maintenance` (30 char limit)
- Captures secondary keywords

**Keywords** (100 char limit, comma-separated):
```
home repair, appliance, troubleshooting, HVAC, plumbing, maintenance, DIY, fix, homeowner, house
```

**Screenshots Strategy**:
1. "My AC stopped working" → context-aware answer
2. Home profile showing personalization
3. Maintenance schedule with alerts
4. "Find a Pro" service provider connection
5. Before/after problem solved

**App Preview Video**: 15-30 second demo showing troubleshooting flow

#### ASO Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| App Store impressions | 10K+/month |
| Conversion rate (impression → install) | 25%+ |
| Keyword rankings (top 10) | 5+ keywords |
| Organic installs | 500+/month |

---

### P0: Content Marketing & SEO

#### Blog/Content Hub Strategy

Create SEO-optimized content for high-volume troubleshooting queries:

**Target Keywords** (by search volume):

| Keyword | Monthly Searches | Difficulty | Content Type |
|---------|------------------|------------|--------------|
| "AC not cooling" | 40K | Medium | Guide |
| "toilet running" | 30K | Medium | Guide |
| "dishwasher not draining" | 25K | Medium | Guide |
| "water heater not working" | 20K | Medium | Guide |
| "HVAC maintenance schedule" | 8K | Low | Checklist |
| "home maintenance checklist" | 15K | Medium | Checklist |
| "when to call a plumber" | 5K | Low | Guide |

**Content Format**:
- Problem → Quick check → Detailed diagnosis → Solution → "Download the app for personalized help"
- Each article ends with CTA: "Get answers specific to YOUR home"

**Content Velocity**: 4 articles/month for first 6 months = 24 pieces of content

---

### P1: Referral Program

#### Mechanics

|---------|---------|

#### Viral Coefficient Target

|--------|--------|
| Users who share | 15% |
